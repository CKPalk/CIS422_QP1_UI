Atlee's TODO:

> Cameron is finalizing the Contact INDEXES so that index 0 always corresponds to a specific field.

> I need to redesign the Add/Edit dialog such that it doesn't look like crap.
> It should look like the sketch I drew and e-mailed to everyone, EXCEPT WITHOUT the email field.
> Widths and positions can be hardcoded - the dialog will not be resizable at this point.
> Cameron's validation code will accept a FIELD INDEX and a VALUE, and return TRUE if it PASSES, else FALSE:
	> any field index past 7 (hardcoded) will automatically PASS.

> Add Import/Export to File menu.
> Import:
	> ASK user for filename
	> ATTEMPT to VirtualAddressBookIO.import(...)
	> 
> Export:
	> IF nothing selected, ASK if they want to export entire address book
	> IF something selected, ASK if they want to export just those selected contacts
	> IF current address book has extra fields, CONFIRM with the user that those fields will be lost (yes/cancel)
		> maybe merge this dialog with both of the above dialogs, as needed
	> ASK user for filename
	
> TEST that both Cameron's and Assembla's gits are working
